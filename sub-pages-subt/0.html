                Hi Jax! Welcome to Subterranean Singapore.\
                You have been subjugated under the hierarchical system that exists today.\
                You live underground, near the Earth’s core.\
                Unfortunately, being a Subterranean means that you are at the bottom of this pecking order and life isn’t as splendid as your fellow citizens above.\
                Your daily life revolves around spinning on bikes to generate power for the entire city (both Subterraneans and Aeronauts).\
                The amount of credits you earn depends on the hours you spend labouring on the bike.\
                You have always wondered what it would be like to live as an Aeronaut and hope to one day reach that goal.\
                How you allocate your time is entirely up to you but just know that there is hope for you to advance to the society of Aeronauts!\
                When you attain enough credits that is.\
                <br/><br/>\
                Warning:\
                You may spend your time as you wish but beware, having a total of less than 50 credits sends you to isolation!\
                There is no room for deadbeats in 23rd century Singapore.\
                <b>You are given 150 credits.</b>\
                Make the right judgements and let the game begin!\
                </p>\
                <h5 class='text-center bg-light'>Credits Bank: 150 credits</h5>"
