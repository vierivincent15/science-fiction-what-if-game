                    <p>
                        We are a team of Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)
                        students that seeks to explore the ethical issues in our society of the
                        future, set in the year 2219. Firstly, in crafting  our future society,
                        we looked at the work of Alberto Vanolo whom we have discussed in class
                        and the ideas that were displayed by artists in the Art Science Museum.
                        In the Art Science Museum, the artists explored a multitude of scenarios,
                        largely related to the environment and how society’s perception of life would
                        change. As living conditions on the Earth’s surface were no longer suitable
                        for humans, life started to migrate underground after having made significant
                        progress to make the underground environment habitable. However, as not everything
                        could be transported below, the idea of sky cities for the sustenance of animals
                        and plants was born. In his work, Alberto explored the four imaginaries of smart
                        cities questioning the position of citizens. However all four imaginaries locate
                        citizens in a subaltern position as he feels that the smart cities vision has a
                        large disconnect from societal needs and aspirations. In coming up with the
                        subterranean society, we took inspiration from Alberto’s subjugated citizens
                        in a dystopian city. In this scenario, citizens become subaltern subjects of
                        the government as countries rely more heavily on technology to sustain and improve
                        life in a harsher climate. Control and privacy are ceded to the government in
                        exchange for integration into the society. On the other hand Aeronauts who are
                        considered the upper class of society partake in active citizenship operating as
                        urban sensors. The citizens in this category are more involved and responsible for
                        taking care of the environment. They help to generate data through the wearable
                        sensors that are incorporated into their daily lives.

                        <b><u>Ethical Issues on the Social Credit System & “Big Brother” Surveillance</u></b>
                        <br/>
                        We have based our game on two key technologies: Social Credit System and
                        “Big Brother” surveillance. 
                        <br/><br/>    
                        According to Rachel Botzman, in the era of a shared economy, a mature credit
                        system plays an important role in society. Just like China’s Social Credit System,
                        this tool is used in smart citizenship and can determine one’s rights and privileges.
                        e.g. Greater number of credits =  higher social standing. With a higher social class,
                        a citizen can gain significant social privileges and benefits (as shown from the path
                        towards obtaining a ministry position). 
                        <br/><br/>    
                        This evaluation system brings about both advantages and disadvantages to society.
                        The Social Credit System is considered a “carrot and stick” approach, which is a
                        traditional motivation theory, in motivating people to elicit good behavior. Both
                        the idea of incentivizing positive behaviour and punishing negative behaviour is
                        portrayed in our game. The evaluation of a person’s trustworthiness benefits those
                        who are more honest and ultimately cultivates a more morally upright society. However,
                        if the system is too rigid, the authenticity of behaviour is compromised and there is a
                        need for citizens to put on a facade. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        On top of that, one big disadvantage of the Social Credit System is the divergence from
                        the posthuman ideal. It goes against the posthuman movement because the system encourages
                        a divide within the society. Based on the amount of credits you have, you are classified as
                        either an upper class or lower class citizen. This results in dualism, separating one group
                        from another.
                        <br/><br/>
                        With regards to surveillance, the main issue is privacy concerns. In our game, the government
                        misuses the smart technology (the contact lenses) to spy on their citizens and monitor their
                        every move. In current day, there is already an example of such technology called “skynet” that
                        uses artificial intelligence, facial recognition and big data analysis. While this current
                        technology is used to tag and track “wanted individuals” through the use of security cameras,
                        the technology may be significantly improved and implemented in smart objects such as contact
                        lenses to track any citizen’s behaviour. After which, the government collect a citizen’s personal
                        data, potentially resulting in privacy infringement without their knowledge.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In the scenario where the player decides to accept or reject the ministry job, it brings about
                        the questions: “Must I really try my best to be a “ideal” citizen to get more credits?” and “At
                        what level must I reach till I am satisfied with my goal in life?” 
                        <br/><br/>
